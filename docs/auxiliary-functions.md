# Auxiliary Functions

  * [appstyle.requestUpload()](docs/auxiliary-functions.md#request-upload) - this prompts the user to upload a file into the browser's localStorage.  be aware, the total size of localStorage for each site/domain is very limited (last I heard, about 5 megabytes in Firefox and 10 in Chrome.)
  * [appstyle.toggleFullScreen()](docs/auxiliary-functions.md#toggle-full-screen) - try to toggle fullscreen mode for the browser.  this is also the default action for double clicking the backdrop (if the backdrop is visible.)
